title: Perturbed Topological Signatures
abstract: 
    - This talk introduces Anirudh Som's "Perturbation Robust Representations of Topological Persistence Diagrams" (ECCV 2018). Som's main contribution is to represent persistence diagrams as points on the Grassmann manifold---called "perturbed topological signatures". These signatures are desirable for computer vision tasks, because metrics defined on the Grassmannian are computationally less complex than distances defined on the space of persistence diagrams.
